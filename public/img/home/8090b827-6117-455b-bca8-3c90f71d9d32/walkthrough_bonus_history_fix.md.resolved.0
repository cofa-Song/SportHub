# Walkthrough - Accessibility Fix (Bonus History)

I have implemented a fix for the console warning: `Blocked aria-hidden on an element because its descendant retained focus`.

## Problem Analysis
The error was caused by a conflict between Chrome's automatic focus on scrollable containers and Naive UI's accessibility management. Specifically:
1.  The main layout content area is a scrollable `div`.
2.  Chrome automatically focuses scrollable `div`s to allow keyboard scrolling.
3.  When a Modal (like the detail view in Bonus History) opens, Naive UI marks the background content as `aria-hidden="true"`.
4.  If the background content container has focus, the browser blocks the `aria-hidden` attribute and throws a warning.

## Changes Made

### 1. Layout Fix
- **Modified**: [Layout.vue](file:///c:/Users/Administrator/Desktop/營運後台/src/views/Master/Layout.vue)
- **Action**: Added `tabindex="-1"` to the main scrollable content container.
- **Result**: This prevents the browser from automatically putting focus on the outer scrollable container, while still allowing the page to be scrolled. This resolves the conflict when a modal is active.

## Verification Results
- The "獎勵卡歷史紀錄" page should no longer trigger this accessibility warning when opening the details modal.
- Scrolling functionality remains unimpaired.
