# Walkthrough - Deposit Order Query Enhancements

I have refactored the "Deposit Order" query interface to exactly match the style and behavior of the "Player List" page, resolving the interaction issues you reported.

## Changes Made

### 1. Style & Layout Alignment
- **New Structure**: Replaced the custom "tech" filter bar with a standard `NCard` and `NForm inline` layout, just like the Player List page.
- **Top Positioning**: Moved the search conditions to the very top of the page (above the statistics and charts) for better accessibility and to prevent overlay issues.
- **Standard Components**: Removed custom CSS classes (`tech-select-light`, etc.) to use standard Naive UI styling, ensuring reliable input behavior and text visibility.

### 2. Fixed Interaction Issues
- **Input Fix**: Resolved the "unable to input Player ID" issue by simplifying the DOM structure and layout.
- **Selection Visibility**: Fixed the issue where selected items weren't showing in the dropdown. By using standard theme-compliant components, the text and tag colors are now correctly rendered.
- **Unified Behavior**: Multi-select dropdowns for "Payment Channel" and "Status" now behave exactly like the "Tags" filter in Player List (standard sizing, clearable, and predictable tag display).

### 3. Label Standardization
- **Clear Labels**: Updated filter labels to use standard translations (e.g., "玩家 ID" and "時間範圍"), ensuring consistency across the management backend.

## Verification Results
- The search bar is now at the top of the page and accepts keyboard input for all fields.
- Selecting options in "支付渠道" and "狀態" correctly displays tags within the input box.
- All text remains clearly readable in light mode.
