# Walkthrough - Third-party Key Management Modifications

I have modified the "Third-party Key Management" interface according to your requirements.

## Changes Made

### 1. Data Structure Updates
- Removed the `environment` field from [ThirdPartyKey](file:///c:/Users/Administrator/Desktop/%E7%87%9F%E9%81%8B%E5%BE%8C%E5%8F%B0/src/types/thirdparty.ts#3-18) and [CreateThirdPartyKeyRequest](file:///c:/Users/Administrator/Desktop/%E7%87%9F%E9%81%8B%E5%BE%8C%E5%8F%B0/src/types/thirdparty.ts#19-30) models.
- Added an optional `proxy` field (string) to the models.
- Cleaned up mock data to match the new structure.

### 2. UI Enhancements
- **List View**: Removed the "環境" (Environment) column to simplify the overview.
- **Form View (Add/Edit)**:
    - Removed the "連線環境" radio buttons.
    - Added a new "Proxy" input field for better connection management.

## Verification Results

### UI Changes
- The environment column is no longer visible in the table.
- The Proxy field is available in the modal when adding or editing a key.

### Code Quality
- Updated type definitions to ensure type safety.
- Adjusted API mock logic to handle the new `proxy` field.
- Cleaned up unused imports and addressed lint warnings.
