# Enhancement Walkthrough

Recent updates to the Operation Management Dashboard.

## 1. System Health Monitoring UI/UX
Redesigned the "System Status" page with a premium layout.
- **Detailed Resources**: CPU, Memory (GB), Disk usage with circular indicators and status-based coloring.
- **KPI Cards**: Interactive cards for Latency, Errors, and QPS.
- **Error Logs**: Clickable error card opens a modal with a detailed table of API endpoints, timestamps, and severity levels.
- **Automatic Toggles**: Added service status switches with an "Access Operation" batch-save workflow.

## 2. Guild Member List
Added the ability to view members within the Guild Management module.
- **Action Button**: "成員名單" (Member List) button in the guild table.
- **Member Details**: Modal displaying Member IDs, ranks, contribution points, and last active status.
- **Navigation**: Quick links from Member IDs to their Player Detail pages.

## 3. Commodity Management Improvements
- **Fallback Imagery**: Implemented automatic placeholder image fallback for broken or invalid product image URLs.
- **VIP Restriction Logic**: Simplified VIP level requirements from multi-select checkboxes to a single-select "Minimum VIP Level" dropdown.
- **Diverse Mock Data**: Expanded the product list to include Monthly Cards, First Deposit Bonuses, and Limited Time Offers.

### Verification of VIP Restriction
The VIP level selection now uses a threshold logic:
- Selecting **VIP 0** allows all players to buy.
- Selecting **VIP 5** allows players with VIP 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, or 10 to see/buy the item.
- The UI automatically calculates the correct permission array for the backend.
