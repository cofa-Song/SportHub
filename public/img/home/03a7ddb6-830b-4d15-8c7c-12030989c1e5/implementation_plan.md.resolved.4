# Plan: Refine Admin Status Management

The goal is to move account status management exclusively to the "Edit Account" dialog and enforce a mandatory "Change Reason" for all account modifications.

## Proposed Changes

### Components

#### [MODIFY] [AccountManagement.vue](file:///c:/Users/Administrator/Desktop/營運後台/src/views/Master/AccountManagement.vue)
- **Table**: Remove the `NSwitch` from the "Account Status" column. Keep only the `NTag` displaying the status.
- **Form State**: Add a `reason` field to `accountForm`.
- **Form UI**: 
    - Add an `NFormItem` for "Change Reason" (異動原因) in the account modal.
    - This field should only be mandatory (or only shown) during an edit.
- **Validation**: 
    - Update [handleSaveAccount](file:///c:/Users/Administrator/Desktop/%E7%87%9F%E9%81%8B%E5%BE%8C%E5%8F%B0/src/views/Master/AccountManagement.vue#252-337) to check if `reason` is provided when `editingAccountId` is present.
- **Logic Cleanup**: Remove [handleToggleStatus](file:///c:/Users/Administrator/Desktop/%E7%87%9F%E9%81%8B%E5%BE%8C%E5%8F%B0/src/views/Master/AccountManagement.vue#359-383) as it's no longer needed for quick toggling.

### Locales

#### [MODIFY] [index.ts](file:///c:/Users/Administrator/Desktop/營運後台/src/locales/index.ts)
- Add labels for "Change Reason" and corresponding validation messages to `permission.accountManagement`.

## Verification Plan

### Manual Verification
1. Navigate to "Admin List".
2. Verify that the switch in the "Account Status" column is gone.
3. Click "Edit" on an admin account.
4. Verify the "Change Reason" field is present.
5. Try to save without filling the reason; verify that an error message appears.
6. Fill the reason and change the status, then save; verify the status is updated.
7. Verify that for "New Account", the reason field is NOT required (or not shown).
