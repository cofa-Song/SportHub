# Plan: Modify Group Permission Settings

The goal is to enhance the permission configuration in the "Group Settings" dialog. We need to ensure that the permission levels (None, Read, Write) are clearly mutually exclusive and add a "Sensitive Data" toggle for each function module.

## Proposed Changes

### Data Types

#### [MODIFY] [index.ts](file:///c:/Users/Administrator/Desktop/營運後台/src/types/index.ts)
- Update [PermissionGroup](file:///c:/Users/Administrator/Desktop/%E7%87%9F%E9%81%8B%E5%BE%8C%E5%8F%B0/src/types/index.ts#32-46) to include `sensitive_permissions: Record<string, boolean>`.

### Components

#### [MODIFY] [GroupManagement.vue](file:///c:/Users/Administrator/Desktop/營運後台/src/views/Master/GroupManagement.vue)
- **Data State**: Add `sensitivePermissions` to `groupForm`.
- **UI Logic**: 
    - Replace the current button-based selection with `NRadioGroup` or fix the button highlighting logic for "None/Read/Write".
    - Add a "Sensitive Data" checkbox (or switch) to the header of each module group in the permission tree.
- **Save Logic**: Ensure the new `sensitivePermissions` are captured and saved.

### Mock Data

#### [MODIFY] [admin.ts](file:///c:/Users/Administrator/Desktop/營運後台/src/mocks/admin.ts)
- Update initial mock groups to include the `sensitive_permissions` field.

## Verification Plan

### Manual Verification
1. Navigate to "Group & Account Management".
2. Edit an existing group.
3. Verify that "None", "Read", and "Write" are mutually exclusive (only one can be active at a time).
4. Verify that each function module (e.g., "系統設定", "帳號管理") has a "Sensitive Data" checkbox.
5. Check and uncheck various options, then click "Save".
6. Re-open the same group and verify that the settings were persisted.
