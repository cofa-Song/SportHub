# Plan: Implementing Menu-Based Breadcrumbs Navigation

Refactor the breadcrumb logic to strictly follow the nested structure defined in `menuOptions`, rather than the flat routing structure.

## Requirement
- Breadcrumbs should reflect the "Layout Menu" hierarchy.
- Example: `Home > Player Management > Player List`.
- Parent menu items (groups) usually do not have a direct route, so they should be non-clickable text in the breadcrumb.
- The root "Home" should always be present? Or just follow the menu?
  - Optimization: Always prepend "Home" (link to dashboard) unless the current page is Home. Then follow the computed menu path.

## Proposed Changes

### [Layout.vue](file:///c:/Users/Administrator/Desktop/營運後台/src/views/Master/Layout.vue)

1.  **Helper Function**: `findMenuPath(menus: MenuOption[], targetKey: string): BreadcrumbItem[] | null`
    - Recursively searches `menuOptions`.
    - Returns an array of items representing the path to the selected key.
    - Each item contains `label` and `key`.

2.  **Computed Property**: `breadcrumbItems`
    - Calls `findMenuPath` with `menuOptions` and `selectedKey`.
    - If the current key is NOT `admin-dashboard`, prepend a "Home" item.

3.  **Template Update**:
    - Add `<NBreadcrumb>` component inside `<NLayoutContent>`, before `<RouterView>`.
    - Iterate over `breadcrumbItems`.
    - If it's the last item (current page) or a parent group without a route (checked via `menuKeyToRoute`), render as text.
    - If it's "Home" or has a valid route, render as a link.

## Verification Plan
1.  Navigate to "Player List".
2.  Check Breadcrumb: Should show `Home > Player Management > Player List`.
3.  Click "Home" -> redirects to dashboard.
4.  Navigate to "Permissions > Personal Account".
5.  Check Breadcrumb: `Home > Permissions > Personal Account`.
