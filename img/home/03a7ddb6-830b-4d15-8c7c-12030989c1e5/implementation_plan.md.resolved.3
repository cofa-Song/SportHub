# Plan: Consolidate Operation Logs and Enhance Display

The goal is to merge "Player Operation Logs" into the "Admin Operation Logs" and ensure all admin activities are recorded in a single place. Additionally, we will replace cryptic module codes (like OPE-103) with their human-readable names.

## Proposed Changes

### Navigation & Routing

#### [MODIFY] [Layout.vue](file:///c:/Users/Administrator/Desktop/營運後台/src/views/Master/Layout.vue)
- Remove the "Player Operation Log" (玩家操作日誌) item from the "Player Management" group.
- Ensure the "Operation Log" (後台操作日誌) under "Permission Management" remains as the central log view.
- Update `watch` and `menuKeyToRoute` to reflect the removal.

#### [MODIFY] [index.ts](file:///c:/Users/Administrator/Desktop/營運後台/src/router/index.ts)
- Remove the route for `/admin/player-logs`.

### Log View Enhancement

#### [MODIFY] [OperationLog.vue](file:///c:/Users/Administrator/Desktop/營運後台/src/views/Master/OperationLog.vue)
- Add a mapping function to convert module codes (e.g., `OPE-102`) to readable names (e.g., `群組與帳號管理`).
- Use this mapping in the table display and detail view.
- Ensure the filters correctly use the readable names or handle the mapping.

### Data Model & Mocks

#### [MODIFY] [admin.ts](file:///c:/Users/Administrator/Desktop/營運後台/src/mocks/admin.ts)
- Add representative mock logs for player-related operations (e.g., `OPS-601`, `OPS-603`) to demonstrate the integration.

## Verification Plan

### Manual Verification
1. Navigate to "Permission Management > Operation Log".
2. Verify that the "Module" column displays names (e.g., "群組與帳號管理") instead of codes (OPE-102).
3. Verify that player-related operation logs are visible in this combined list.
4. Open a detail view and verify the module name is correctly displayed.
5. Check the sidebar and confirm "Player Operation Log" is gone.
6. Verify searching/filtering by module still works with the new names.
