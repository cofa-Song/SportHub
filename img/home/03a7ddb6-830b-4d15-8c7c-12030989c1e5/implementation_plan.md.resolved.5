# Plan: Menu Restructuring and Home Page Reassignment

The goal is to simplify the navigation by removing unused modules, renaming the entry point, and redirecting the home page to Personal Account Management.

## Proposed Changes

### Locales

#### [MODIFY] [index.ts](file:///c:/Users/Administrator/Desktop/營運後台/src/locales/index.ts)
- Rename `navigation.dashboard` to "Home" (`首頁`).
- (Optional) Remove unused merchant-related translation keys.

### Routing

#### [MODIFY] [index.ts](file:///c:/Users/Administrator/Desktop/營運後台/src/router/index.ts)
- Update the redirect for the `/admin` path (or the base route) to point to `/admin/account` (Personal Account Management).
- Remove the merchant management route if it exists.

### Layout & Navigation

#### [MODIFY] [Layout.vue](file:///c:/Users/Administrator/Desktop/營運後台/src/views/Master/Layout.vue)
- Remove the "Merchant Management" item from the menu structure.
- Ensure the "Home" item (formerly Dashboard) is mapped correctly to the `/admin/account` route in `menuKeyToRoute`.
- Since "Home" is now "Personal Account Management", we should avoid redundant entries if they both exist in the menu.

## Verification Plan

### Manual Verification
1. Log in and check if the initial page is "Personal Account Management".
2. Verify the side menu: "Dashboard" should be "Home" (`首頁`).
3. Verify that "Merchant Management" is completely removed from the menu.
4. Click on "Home" and ensure it stays on or navigates to "Personal Account Management".
5. Verify no broken links or redirect loops.
