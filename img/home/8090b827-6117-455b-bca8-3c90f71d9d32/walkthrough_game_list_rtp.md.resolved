# Walkthrough - Game List Terminology Update (RTP)

I have updated the "Game List" module to use "RTP" (Return to Player) terminology instead of "Win Rate" or "Kill Rate" (殺率), as requested.

## Changes Made

### 1. Translation Updates
- **Statistics**: "統計殺率" has been renamed to **"統計RTP"**.
- **Settings**: "設置殺率" has been renamed to **"設置RTP"**.
- **Edit Modal**: The field "殺率" has been renamed to **"RTP"**.
- Updated both instances of these keys in [src/locales/index.ts](file:///c:/Users/Administrator/Desktop/%E7%87%9F%E9%81%8B%E5%BE%8C%E5%8F%B0/src/locales/index.ts) to ensure consistency.

### 2. Logic & Calculation Adjustments ([GameList.vue](file:///c:/Users/Administrator/Desktop/%E7%87%9F%E9%81%8B%E5%BE%8C%E5%8F%B0/src/views/Master/GameList.vue))
To ensure the values displayed correctly reflect the new "RTP" labels, I have adjusted the underlying logic:

- **Stats RTP Column**:
    - Changed calculation from Margin ([(Bet - Payout) / Bet](file:///c:/Users/Administrator/Desktop/%E7%87%9F%E9%81%8B%E5%BE%8C%E5%8F%B0/src/api/article.ts#38-44)) to actual RTP (`Payout / Bet`).
    - **Color Coding**: RTP ≤ 100% is now shown in **green** (healthy for the platform), while RTP > 100% is shown in **red**.
- **Set RTP Column & Editing**:
    - The UI now displays the **Inverse Margin** (e.g., if the margin is 5%, it displays 95% RTP).
    - **Edit Modal**: When you input a value like `95` for RTP, the system automatically converts and saves it as a `5%` profit margin in the background, maintaining compatibility with existing data structures.

## Verification Results
- The "Game List" table now shows "統計RTP" and "設置RTP" columns.
- The edit modal correctly displays "RTP" as a percentage input.
- All "殺率" (Kill Rate) mentions have been removed from the source code.
