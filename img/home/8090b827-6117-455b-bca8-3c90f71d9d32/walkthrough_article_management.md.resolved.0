# Walkthrough - Article Management Modifications

I have modified the "Article Management" editor to include a more powerful rich text editor and simplified the SEO metadata options.

## Changes Made

### 1. TinyMCE Editor Integration
- **New Feature**: Replaced the basic textarea with a full **TinyMCE** rich text editor.
- **Functionality**: Provides standard formatting tools (bold, italic, alignment, lists, etc.) while keeping the implementation lightweight via CDN.
- **Component**: Created a reusable [TinymceEditor.vue](file:///c:/Users/Administrator/Desktop/%E7%87%9F%E9%81%8B%E5%BE%8C%E5%8F%B0/src/components/TinymceEditor.vue) component.

### 2. SEO Field Cleanup
- **Requirement**: Removed the "Meta Keywords" field from the SEO optimization tab, as requested.
- **Consistency**: Updated the data types and initial states to ensure the application remains stable after the field removal.

## Verification Results
- **Editor**: TinyMCE loads correctly when opening the Add/Edit drawer and supports real-time synchronization with the form state.
- **SEO**: The "SEO 優化" tab now only contains "Meta Title" and "Meta Description".
- **Data Integrity**: Articles can still be saved and updated correctly; the `meta_keywords` property is no longer sent to the API.
