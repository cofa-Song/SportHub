# Walkthrough - Deposit Order Query Enhancements

I have improved the "Deposit Order" query interface by adding new filtering capabilities and fixing several UI/UX issues.

## Changes Made

### 1. New "Status" Filter
- **Feature**: Added a "狀態" (Status) multi-select dropdown to the search bar.
- **Functionality**: Allows users to filter orders by one or more statuses (e.g., Pending, Success, Failed).
- **Localization**: Uses existing i18n keys for status labels.

### 2. Layout & Height Fix
- **Improvement**: Both the "Payment Channel" and the new "Status" dropdowns now use **`max-tag-count="responsive"`**.
- **Result**: When multiple options are selected, the input field will correctly collapse extra tags into a "+X" indicator, preventing the search bar from expanding vertically and breaking the layout.

### 3. Selection Visibility Fix
- **CSS**: Optimized the `.tech-select-light` styling.
- **Fix**: Ensuring that the text within selected tags is clearly visible (dark slate color) against the light background, resolving the "white text on white background" issue.

## Verification Results
- The search bar now correctly displays "語言範圍", "P ID 搜尋", "支付渠道", and "狀態".
- Selecting multiple statuses or channels correctly updates the UI without causing layout shifts.
- Selected option tags are now easily readable.
