# UI Beautification & Theme System Walkthrough

Successfully transformed the operations dashboard into a modern, premium interface with full support for Light and Dark (Eye Protection) modes.

## Highlights

### 1. Theme Switching Capability
Implemented a global theme system using Naive UI's `NConfigProvider`.
- **Toggle Control**: Located in the top-right header for easy access.
- **Persistence**: Remembers the user's choice across sessions via `localStorage`.

### 2. Premium "Glassmorphism" Design
The interface now features a sophisticated visual style:
- **Semi-transparent Blur**: Sidebar and Header backgrounds use backdrop filters for a modern frost-glass effect.
- **Vibrant Accents**: Improved color palettes and shadows for a "high-end" feel.
- **Micro-animations**: Smooth transitions for theme switching and content entrance.

## Changes Made

### Global Configuration
- [App.vue](file:///c:/Users/Administrator/Desktop/%E7%87%9F%E9%81%8B%E5%BE%8C%E5%8F%B0/src/App.vue): Integrated Naive UI's `darkTheme` and global theme overrides.
- [style.css](file:///c:/Users/Administrator/Desktop/%E7%87%9F%E9%81%8B%E5%BE%8C%E5%8F%B0/src/style.css): Defined premium design tokens and utility classes.

### Layout Refinement
- [Layout.vue](file:///c:/Users/Administrator/Desktop/%E7%87%9F%E9%81%8B%E5%BE%8C%E5%8F%B0/src/views/Master/Layout.vue): 
    - Added theme toggle logic and UI.
    - Redesigned Sidebar with a central logo and better spacing.
    - Integrated Breadcrumbs into the Header for a cleaner workspace.
    - Added user avatar and improved dropdown menu.

## How to Test
1. **Toggle Mode**: Click the Sun/Moon icon in the header to switch between Light and Dark modes.
2. **Observe UI**: Note the glassmorphism effects on the sidebar and header.
3. **Verify Details**: Check that all text remains perfectly readable and that the interactive states (hover/active) are consistent.
