# Competition Blog Frontend Implementation Plan

This plan outlines the development of a high-performance, SEO-optimized sports blog website using Next.js.

## Proposed Changes

### Project Setup
- [NEW] Initialize Next.js project with App Router, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS.
- [NEW] Configure `tailwind.config.js` with project-specific theme tokens.
- [NEW] Set up core directory structure with high modularity:
  - `components/ui/`: Atomic components (Button, Input, Badge, etc.)
  - `components/shared/`: Cross-page functional modules (ScoreCard, PostPreview, UserAvatar, etc.)
  - `components/layout/`: Global layout components (Header, Footer, Sidebar)
  - `hooks/`: Shared logic (useScores, useMatchEvents, etc.)
  - `lib/`: Utils and constants
  - `services/`: API client
  - `app/`: Next.js pages

### Design System
- Implement a premium sports-themed design system using Tailwind CSS utilities.
- Colors: Custom palette defined in `tailwind.config.ts`.
- Components: Fully modular UI kit for consistent look and feel across the site.
- Interactivity: Tailwind's transition and animation utilities for smooth UX.


### Features
- **Homepage**: Hero section with featured matches, latest news grid, and category filtering.
- **Match Center**: A dedicated area for real-time scores (mocked initially for later Go backend integration).
- **SEO Library**: Centralized metadata management for posts and pages.
- **Editor Experience**: Implementation of a clean UI for content creators.

## Verification Plan

### Automated Tests
- `npm run build`: Verify production build stability.
- `npx tsc`: Type check all files.

### Manual Verification
- Verify responsive layouts on desktop and mobile.
- Check lighthouse scores for SEO and Performance.
- Test real-time score updates simulation.
